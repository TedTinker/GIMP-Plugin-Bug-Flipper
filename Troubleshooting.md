Problem: The plug-ins are not appearing in the GIMP’s Filter drop-down menu.

Check to see if Python-fu is featured in the GIMP’s Filter drop-down menu. 

If it isn’t, Python isn’t installed in a manner compatible with the GIMP. Try re-installing PyCairo, PyGtk, and PyGObject through PyGtk’s all-in-one installer (32 bit), or installing a different version of Python.

If it is, make sure the file for the plug-in in the GIMP’s plug-in folder is a .py file, not a text file. Also make sure it is executable.

Otherwise, there may be a syntax error in the code (if it’s been modified since its download from GitHub). Launch the GIMP from the terminal with the --verbose environment to check for errors.



Problem:When settings are entered for the plug-in and the user selects “OK”, nothing happens.

Did the plug-in’s setting dialog box disappear?

If not, the program may be trying to open an image. Large, high-resolution images may take several seconds to open.

If the settings dialog box did disappear, make sure there are actually photos in the first specified folder which the chosen settings will select. If the suffix string option is set to its default of “.jpg” but all the photos are of the type “.JPG,” for instance, the settings dialog box closes because the plug-in has no photos to process.
