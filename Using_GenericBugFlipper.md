First, collect the photos which must be processed in one folder. Decide on a folder into which you would like to save the processed images. 

Then open the GIMP. If all the components have been installed correctly, Generic-Bug-Flipper will appear in the GIMP’s drop-down menu labeled Filter, beneath Python-fu. 

With no images open in the GIMP, select Generic-Bug-Flipper from the Filter drop-down. This should open a dialog box prompting the user for the following options:

“Folder with photos”: Choose the folder containing the photos to process. The default is the C drive. To choose another folder, select “other” from the drop-down. (Editing_GenericBugFlipper explains how to change the default settings.)

“Folder to save photos”: Choose the folder into which the photos should be saved. The default is the C drive. To choose another folder, select “other” from the drop-down. 

“Filenames begin with…”: Type a string. Photos in the the first folder will be processed only if their filename begins with that string. The default is “DSC_”, a common prefix for raw camera photos at Cheadle Center. Empty this field to process files regardless of how their filename begins.

“Filenames end with…”: Type a string. Photos in the the first folder will be processed only if their filename ends with that string.  The default is “.jpg”, the most common file type used for photography at Cheadle Center. Empty this field to process files regardless of how their filename ends (which may produce errors if the plug-in tries to open a file which is not an image). These fields are case-sensitive. 

“Rename/Edit photos?”: Select “yes” or “no.” The default is “yes”. 

If run using “yes,” each image will be processed and then displayed in the GIMP one at a time. The user may then edit the photo (for example, cropping it by hand). As the image is displayed a dialog box appears asking for a filename. When the user clicks the button labeled “Enter” in the dialog box, or types the enter key while typing in the filename entry-box, the display is removed and the image is saved with the filename given. Leave the entry-box empty to save using the old filename instead of a new one. Below the entry-box the user may mark a checkbox to flag the photograph as of poor quality; then the string “bad_pic_” will be appended to the filename returned. (In the case of Cheadle Hall entomology, each photograph contains a QR code. After cropping, the user may click in the filename-entry-box and scan the QR code to automatically save the photo with the proper name and move to the next image.)

If run using “no,” the images are processed but not displayed. No human input is needed.

“Rotate Photos?”: Select whether each photo should be rotated 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, or not at all. The default is no rotation at all.

“Run white-balance/color-correction?”: Select “yes” or “no.” The default is “yes.” The white-balance and color-correction plug-in was written by Diego Nassetti.

“Delete old photos after processing?”: Select “yes” or “no.” The default is “no.” If the plug-in is run using “yes,” the old image is deleted when the processed image is saved. (Never use this if pulling photos from and saving to the same folder without renaming; each saved file will replace the original, and then it will be deleted.)

“Saved Image Quality”: Use the slider-bar to choose a number between .01 and 1. The default is .3. Using 1 saves the image without compressing it. Using .01 saves the image with maximum compression (most detail is lost, but large, high-contrast writing may be legible). Using .3 saves the image with some compression. 

When these options have been set, click the Enter button to run the plug-in. It may take a moment for each image to be displayed, especially if the photographs are high-resolution. 

Because each image is processed and saved one at a time, the program may be terminated at any moment by closing the GIMP; ignore error messages which may result.
