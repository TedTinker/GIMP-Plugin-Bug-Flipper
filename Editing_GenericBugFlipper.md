GenericBugFlipper.py may be opened in most text editors including Notepad and TextWrangler. 

For changes to the code to take effect, the changes must be saved before the GIMP is opened. 

The program consists of six sections:

The copyright section includes a brief description of the program and a reminder that the plug-in is freeware and may be distributed and modified for any purposes commercial or non-commercial, under Version 3 of the GNU General Public License. This copyright notice should be updated to reflect modifications made.

The preamble imports procedures from gimpfu, which allows the program to access the GIMP Procedural Database (PDB). It also imports os for accessing files and folders and gtk for constructing dialog boxes.

The first functions describe the gtk dialog box which appears when images are displayed to be renamed. The dialog box contains a text-entry box and a checkbox packed vertically using gtk widget packing. When the user confirms the dialog, the dialog returns only a text string to use as an image-name; the user is able to edit the displayed image before the dialog box is closed because the program is waiting for the dialog to return a value. 

The next function is responsible for pulling appropriate files from the first folder to process using a for-loop. After each image is processed and saved, the old file is deleted, if the user so chose.

The last function is the function called to process each image. Note that the initial declaration of “image” and “drawable” does not actually display the file on the screen; this saves processing time if the user never needs to see the image to process it properly. Each procedure is applied to each image based on the options selected by the user when the plug-in began. This function returns nothing because its desired intention is the “side-effect” of saving the image and moving to the next step of the for-loop described above. 

The final section is the registry, which provides the GIMP with basic features of the plug-in. First it specifies the name of the program, a description, a help-message, etcetera. The empty string “” in the eighth position signifies that no image need be displayed in the GIMP for the program to function; the plug-in will open images on its own. Then the registry enumerates the variables which the user should enter when the plug-in is initially clicked. For most variables the default setting is the last element of the associated list in parentheses; for variables like PF_RADIO and PF_SLIDER, the default is the second-to-last element of that list because an additional element is required. The following empty square brackets represent that the plug-in returns no value. Finally the plug-in is placed in the GIMP’s drop-down menu “menu=“<Toolbox>/Filters”)” and the main function is run. By changing the register function the plug-in may be moved in the GIMP’s menus and the default settings may be changed.

Armed with this description of the plug-in’s functioning, it should be possible to modify features to expand the usage of the program.
