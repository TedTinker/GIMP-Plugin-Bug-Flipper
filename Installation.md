The plug-in BugFlipper should function on any operating system which can run its required components, but has been written and tested specifically in Windows 7 and Sierra. The installation process for Windows follows (links to referenced materials follow; more recent versions of the GIMP may be used with semi-reliability):

Download and install Python version 2.6.6 (32 bit). Restart the computer.

Download PyGtkâ€™s all-in-one installer (32 bit). Use it to install PyCairo, PyGtk, and PyGObject. Restart the computer.

Download and install the latest stable version of the GIMP (32 bit). Restart the computer.

Download BugFlipper.py or GenericBugFlipper.py from GitHub into the folder .gimp-2.6 > plug-ins. 

Open the GIMP (the first opening of the GIMP may take some time as it loads fonts). If the installation was performed successfully, the function Bug-Flipper or Generic-Bug-Flipper will appear under the Filters tab.

The installation process for Windows and Linux should be similar.
